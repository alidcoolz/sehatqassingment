1.    In the Linux system, what is the correlation between, hdd out of space and socket file ?
not realy sure, i think no correlation between hdd out of space and socket file. socket operate in memory.

       Why we cannot perform a connection if our harddrive space is running out.
it can happened cause At lot of daemon do access logging. If the disk out of space, 
it might happen that logging from daemon / process will be fails and no more network requests are possible
 

2.    How to whitelist user on ssh login, without removing their public key on the servers ?

 i think we can just add AllowUsers [User_id] on sshd_config then reloading ssh service

3.    My lead ask me to check uptime in 200 server, it is really takes time if i have to ssh into every server and run the uptime command.

Write ansible adhoc command to solve this, just adhoc command, no need use playbook.

And your ansible inventory is ready.

ansible -i ansible-inventory -a /usr/bin/uptime

4.    What is the first step you do if you want to generate SSL certificate ?

5.    I have a web page,

https://www.sehatq.com/abc/def

My boss want me to redirect to page to /


How to do this on NGINX web server ? create the NGINX rewrite rules for this case.

add this following block to site.conf of nginx

server{
...
    location /abc/def{
        rewrite /abc/def/ / redirect;
    }
...
}

6.    One of QA engineer got an issue when uploading a file to our backend, she got 413 error codes. What is the meaning of those HTTP code and how to solve it on NGINX configuration ?

it mean that nginx server doesn't allow to upload file larger than size which defined in nginx config file

we can increase the value of "client_max_body_size" on nginx.conf 

then restart nginx service
 

7.    What is the meaning of the orphan process ? How does that happen ?

 
i think Orphan processes are childs processes that running without their parent process, 
it can happen cause their parent process maybe has terminated or finished but the child still stuck (maybe the parent terminated forcely, 
or maybe when stopping the parent process the time for stopping the child process not enough, 
or maybe another issues like crashes and so on, it sometime happens accidentaly
