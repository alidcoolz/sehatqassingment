Section C:  Kubernetes Questions

 

1. What is the difference between ingress controller and ingress resources
ingress controller is responsible for fulfilling the Ingress as load balancer / frontend

ingress Resources is use for make the service can be accessed outside the cluster.

In order for the Ingress resource to work, the cluster must have an Ingress controller running.

2. In managed kubernetes service (EKS, GKE, AKS ) what will happen when you install ingress controller ? the internal network in the cluster can be accessed from external

3. I already deployed HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler ) but it seems the HPA didnâ€™t get the metric (unknown). In your experience, what could be the cause of this issue ?
it could be broken InternalIP / hostname

4. Take a backup of the etcd cluster and save it to /tmp/etcd-backup.db

etcdctl snapshot save /tmp/etcd-backup.db

5. Create a Pod called redis-storage with image: redis:alpine with a Volume of type emptyDir that lasts for the life of the Pod. Specs on the right. Just write the manifest

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: redis-storage
spec:
  containers:
  - name: redis-storage
    image: redis:alpine
    volumeMounts:
    - name: redis-storage
      mountPath: /data/redis-storage
  volumes:
  - name: redis-storage
    emptyDir: {}

6. How to get the internal IP address of all nodes using jsonpath

kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath={.items[*].status.addresses[?\(@.type==\"InternalIP\"\)].address}

7. What is the difference between taint and toleration and when to use it ?

Taints and tolerations works together to ensure that pods are not scheduled onto inappropriate nodes. Taints are a property of nodes that push pods away if they don't tolerate this taint. Tolerations are applied to pods, and allow the pods to schedule onto nodes with matching taints.

it useful for case if you want to work with dedicated nodes, with very specific parameters like high CPU, or use these nodes only for specific applications.
